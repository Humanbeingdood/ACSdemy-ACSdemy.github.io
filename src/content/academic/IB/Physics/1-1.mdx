# Measurement

## Fundamental and derived SI units

The metric system is just better than the imperial system. That's all you gotta know.
    
## Scientific notation and metric multipliers

Scientific notation consists of a decimal number ranging from 1 up to below 10 multiplied by a power of 10.
Metric multpliers are prefixes added before an SI unit in order to express a different order of magnitude.

New line hehehe...

## Significant figures

For a certain value, all figures are significant, except:

-Leading zeros

-Trailing zeros if this value does not have a decimal point

When multiplying or dividing numbers, the number of significant figures of the result value should not exceed the least precise value of the calculation.
The number of significant figures in any answer should be consistent with the number of significant figures of the given data in the question.

## Orders of magnitude

Orders of magnitude are given in powers of 10, likewise those given in the scientific notation section previously.
Orders of magnitude are used to compare the size of physical data.
    
## Estimation

Estimations are usually made to the nearest power of 10. Some examples are given in the tables in the orders of magnitude section.
